# JSON Highlighter with RichTextFX and Jackson

## Overview
This repository provides a Java-based application that renders highlighted JSON using the RichTextFX library for the text editor and Jackson for JSON parsing. 
The application comes with predefined color schemes through a theme loader but allows for customization via CSS.
